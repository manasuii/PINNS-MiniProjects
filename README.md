# PINNS-MiniProjects
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) — Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small, educational PINN implementations designed to demonstrate how neural networks can solve physics-governed systems by enforcing differential equations directly in the loss function. Each project uses TensorFlow, automatic differentiation, and carefully constructed PDE/IC/BC losses.

🔬 Included Projects

1D Motion (ODE) — Learning dynamics from Newton's laws using initial conditions.

Newton's Law of Cooling — Modeling temperature decay governed by a first-order ODE.

Poisson Equation (1D) — Solving a classical boundary value PDE using PINNs.

Projectile Motion — Predicting ball trajectory by embedding physics constraints.

⚙️ Core Techniques

Physics-Informed loss formulation (PDE + IC/BC)

Automatic differentiation for derivatives

Neural network approximation of continuous functions

Comparison with analytical solutions for validation

🎯 Purpose

These mini-projects serve as a compact introduction to Scientific Machine Learning, PINNs, and integrating physics constraints into deep learning models. Ideal for students and beginners exploring PINNs for the first time.
